# Parabiosis
The repository contains jupyter notebooks descripbing downstream analyses of the `Molecular hallmarks of heterochronic parabiosis at single cell resolution`.
Notebooks describe quality control, batch correction, cell type annotation and differential gene expression steps starting from the raw, unfiltered, aligned count matrices. The list of notebooks:
1. Quality control, PC calculation, batch correction, and clustering
2. Batch correction metrics calculation (2.1) includes LISI score claculation in R
3. KNN based cell type annotation
4. Differential Gene Expression
5. Final data formatting steps
6. Data conversion to RDS
